### Testing FAQs ðŸ¤”

Answers to questions you might have around testing

Q: Why do I have to commit my changes to `main`?

A: The `on: issue_comment` workflow only uses workflow files from the `main` branch by design - [learn more in the branch-deploy repo](https://github.com/github/branch-deploy#security-)

Q: How can I test my changes once my PR is merged and *before* a new release is created?

A: You should create a repo like [this one](https://github.com/GrantBirki/actions-sandbox) that uses `github/command@main` as the Action version and test your changes there
