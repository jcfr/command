IssueOps commands in GitHub Actions

![ship-it](docs/assets/ship-it.jpg)

This project is based off the [github/branch-deploy](https://github.com/github/branch-deploy) Action. There are **many** similarities between the two, but there is a key difference. The [github/branch-deploy](https://github.com/github/branch-deploy) Action is designed specifically for deployments via IssueOps where this project (`command`) can be used for **any** IssueOps command. This Action allows you to tailor your IssueOps command exactly how you want.

This Action does the heavy lifting for you to enabled customized IssueOps commands:

- üîç Detects when IssueOps commands are used on a pull request or an issue
- ‚úèÔ∏è Configurable - Choose your command syntax, optional parameters, who can run the commands, what GitHub permissions are required, and much more
- ‚úîÔ∏è Respects your branch protection settings configured for the repo - if commands are run on pull requests
- üó®Ô∏è Reacts to your IssueOps commands
- üöÄ Can be enabled with simple configuration
- üß∂ This Action can be tied into your existing workflows

## Turbo Quickstart ‚ö°

A quick section to get you started with this Action

### Usage üìù

Basic usage assuming all defaults:

```yaml

    reaction: "eyes"
    allowed_contexts: "pull_request,issue"
